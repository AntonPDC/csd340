      <p class="intro">
        I was born and raised in Columbia, Maryland, a small suburb known for
        its beautiful landscapes and friendly community. Growing up, I spent my
        days exploring nature and playing with friends. One of my fondest
        memories is visiting the local library, where I discovered my love for
        books.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thanks to my siblings and neighborhood friends, my childhood was filled
        with adventures. We loved to play <span id="span1">________</span>,
        build forts, and ride our bikes around town.
        <button onclick="replaceText('span1', word1)">Reveal Word</button>
      </p>

      <p>
        In my free time, I enjoy several hobbies, including gaming, coding, and
        working with <span id="span2">________</span>.
        <button onclick="replaceText('span2', word2)">Reveal Word</button>
      </p>

      <p>
        One of my favorite places to visit is the
        <span id="span3">________</span>, where I can relax and enjoy the fresh
        air.
        <button onclick="replaceText('span3', word3)">Reveal Word</button>
      </p>

      <p>
        Family has always been an important part of my life. I have a wife and a
        daughter, with another one due on Monday, January 13th, 2025. I am/was
        also close to my <span id="span4">________</span> while I was growing
        up.
